In the recent developments of covid-related social issues globally impacting billions of people, we created a system aiding in automated door opening/closing, sanitizer dispensing, Mask Recognition using embedded systems, artificial intelligence and an attendance monitoring web application, to automate the whole entry-system adhering to covid-19 norms.

This is the web application part of that project.

Happy coding :)
